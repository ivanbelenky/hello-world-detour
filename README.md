 # Hello World Detour

Python allows to do stuff very easily. 

This is the first chapter of a series that document the process of doing something trivial, the hard(est?) way. In this manner the desired scope is to push to the limit my creativity and learning abilities through forced detours.

The detours present on this first repository tackled some slicky recursive ways of finding N-grams from a set of characters, this developed into reading more about  Zipf's Law, as well as familiarizing (just the surface) with some of the more basics NLP models. Finally (since data corpus for ngrams are hard to find publicly) using the request module to GET info from Google Ngram Books Api.

This problem is not closed, even if the "hello world" string was found from the scrambled characters, there is surely more detours that provide learning about weird stuff I take for granted. 

Please feel free to increase the dumbness of this objective, and add as many detours as desired.
Cheers.
